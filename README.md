# ENSL-GatherBOT
This bot is designed to :   

* Remind you when gathers are about to start, giving you a chance to resign in due time.   

* Announce when empty spots for the next gather are getting occupied - Encouraging you to join in the last minute.  This makes it much easier for people who can't put off 2 hours of their schedule to wait for gathers etc.   

* Announce when the gather has started and will link you to the gather page, as well as direct you to the game server.  This allows you to close your internet browser while you're waiting for the gather to start.
